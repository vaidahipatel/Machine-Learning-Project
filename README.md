# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine learning project which focuses on different types of models concerning Malware detection based on Cloud Computing.


Malware

Malware often known as malicious software, is any programme or file designed to harm a computer, network, or server.

Examples

Computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware are examples of malware. These harmful programmes steal, encrypt, and erase important information, as well as altering or hijacking essential computing processes and monitoring end users' computer behavior.

Malware Detection

Every cybersecurity product needs a malware recognition module that is efficient, reliable, and scalable. Based on the data they've gathered, malware identification modules determine whether or not an object is a threat. This information can be gathered in several stages:

Pre-execution phase data refers to information about a file that may be gleaned without running it. This could comprise executable file format descriptions, code descriptions, binary data statistics, text strings, and information retrieved through code emulation, among other things.
Post-execution phase data offers information about the behavior or events that occur as a result of process activity in a system.
Manually constructed detection rules weren't any more practicable due to the rapid growth of the Internet and the resulting surge in malware, necessitating the development of new, powerful protection solutions. Machine learning is now used by anti-malware businesses to improve malware detection using multiple types of data on host, network, and cloud-based anti-malware components.
